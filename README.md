CLI tool to quickly scaffold, package, and deploy minimal full-stack projects with Docker, plus ready-to-use AWS SDK clients (S3, RDS, etc.) from a single C++ binary.

ProjectName (replace with your tool name)

Spin up minimal full-stack projects, Docker-ready, with AWS SDK integration — all from a single CLI.

This C++ CLI tool automates boilerplate creation and packaging, letting you focus on building features instead of setup. It supports:

Frontend frameworks: React

Backend frameworks: Node.js (REST APIs), Java Spring Boot

Docker integration: auto-generated Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and .env files

AWS SDK support: ready-made clients for S3, RDS SQL, and more

Minimalist projects: only the essentials, ready to edit

Project packaging: zips your project, converts it into byte .h files, and bakes into a C++ executable

Easy installation: download from GitHub and optionally add to your PATH

How it works

Choose a project type – React, Node.js, Spring Boot, etc.

Name your project and set a destination – defaults to the current directory

Optionally configure AWS clients – S3, RDS, etc., ready to use

The CLI generates the minimal project structure with Docker support

Projects are packaged as a C++ executable for instant deployment

Perfect for hackathons, demos, rapid prototyping, or AWS-integrated projects, this tool gives you a full-stack workflow with cloud-ready features in seconds.
